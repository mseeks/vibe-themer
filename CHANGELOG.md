# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Vibe Themer" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.15] - 2025-06-07

### Added
- **ðŸš§ Theme Iteration Feature Complete**: Users can now modify existing themes incrementally using natural language
- **AI Intent Detection**: AI automatically detects whether user input is for a new theme or iteration

## [1.0.10] - 2025-06-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved resource file loading issue in packaged extension installations
- Moved `streamingThemePrompt.txt` from `src/prompts/` to `prompts/` (root level) to ensure inclusion in published package
- Updated file loading to use VS Code's proper `context.asAbsolutePath()` API for reliable resource path resolution

- Improved user experience by showing only relevant AI models that begin with "gpt"

## [1.0.8] - 2025-06-01

### Fixed
- **MAJOR FIX**: Added esbuild bundling to include runtime dependencies (openai, zod) in the extension package
- This resolves the root cause of "command not found" errors where dependencies weren't available in the marketplace version
- Extension now properly bundles all required dependencies instead of relying on external node_modules

## [1.0.7] - 2025-06-01

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Made activation function synchronous to ensure commands are registered immediately
- Lowered VS Code engine requirement from ^1.100.0 to ^1.74.0 for broader compatibility
- Moved async OpenAI initialization to happen after command registration to prevent timing issues
- Added proper error handling for OpenAI initialization failures

## [1.0.6] - 2025-06-01

### Fixed

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where compiled output was not included in the VSIX package, causing "command not found" errors in marketplace installs.
